I have implemented Bezier spline in 3 different Ways.
While implementing catmullrom curve I got small bumps in first and last curve. 
While implementing hermite the path was not that clear.
Thanks for your continuous help in piazza and my classmate Tarun helped me a lot in solving this assignment.
